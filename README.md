For Challenge 1, I chose to use a while loop. A while loop made the most sense because the loop will only end once the solution is false. Using the current_number % 2 == 0 / current_number // 2 produces even numbers because it determines if the number can be divided by 2. If it can be, then that number is even.

For Challenge 2, I chose to use a for loop. The for loop made the most sense because it was in a specific range. It checks if the number that is input is prime or not.

For Challenge 3, I also chose to use a for loop. The for loop made the most sense again because I needed each in a certain range. It output all the numbers in the rows and columns. 

I used AI for help on concepts with the multiplication table. I was having trouble with the columns and the rows so I prompted Copilot to explain what my error was and how I should fix it. I also used it for step one because I kept getting my output as two times the expected result. It turns out I had an extra step_count += 1.
